# Feinschmecker

Find something inexpensive and unhealthy to eat at TU Hamburg.

## Motivation

Feinschmecker is a semi-ambitious rewrite of [tuhh-mensa-bot][tmb].  It
is supposed to become more robust and more performant than its
predecessor while also being easier to maintain and deploy.

Most of it is written in Go. Minor parts dealing with text munging and
annoying input are written in Perl.
